# Responsive Video Background
While I was browsing the web, I found many websites using responsive video backgrounds. I was intrigued about how they were made. Hence, I decided to make one. Initially, I did not understand how to make one hence I watched a video made by Kyle from Web Dev Simplified. 

# Reflections
This was not too  difficult of a project, however it was quite annoying to make. This was because I had to use CSS positioning,something which I had not used in a while. 

# Final Thoughts
This was a fairly fun project and was a good way to pass the time. You can view a live preview of the project [here](https://reubenmenezes.github.io/Responsive-Video-Background/)
